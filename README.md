First of all, connect to the VM using SSH:
```sh
$ ssh user@ip_address (ex: ssh nick@12.34.56.789)
```

Then, update the server:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Installing Apache and WSGI
First, to install Apache you'll need to run:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install apache2
```

After that, we need to get WSGI, so run the following:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
```

Once we have that, we need to make sure we've enabled WSGI with the following:
```sh
$ sudo a2enmod wsgi
```

It is probably already enabled from the installation, but it is a good idea to make sure.
Next we are ready to set up our Flask environment.
Run:
```sh
$ cd /var/www/html/
```
